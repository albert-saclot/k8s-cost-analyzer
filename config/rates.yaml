# Source: Derived from AWS EC2 on-demand pricing (us-east-1 region)
# Reference instance: m5.large (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM) at ~$0.096/hour
#   CPU cost: $0.096 / 2 cores = $0.048 per core/hour
#   Memory cost: $0.096 / 8 GB = $0.012 per GB/hour
#   Blended rate adjusted for typical request/limit patterns
#
# These are estimates for general-purpose workloads.
# Users should adjust to match their actual infrastructure costs:
#   - Cloud: Use your cloud provider's compute pricing
#   - On-prem: Calculate based on hardware amortization + overhead
#   - Reserved instances: Apply your discount rate
